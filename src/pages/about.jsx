      <h1>About Crypto Dash</h1>
      <p>ðŸš€ Crypto Dash is a simple React application that displays live cryptocurrency data using the CoinGecko API.</p>  
      <p>ðŸ“Š You can explore the top currencies by market cap, filter them by name or symbol, and sort them by price, market cap, or 24-hour change.</p>  
      <p>ðŸ’» This project was built for self-development, helping to deepen understanding of React hooks, components, state management, and integration with external APIs.</p>  
      <p>ðŸ”® Future improvements could include detailed coin views, pagination, wallet integration, watchlists, and price alerts. With these features, Crypto Dash could become not just a dashboard, but a personal crypto assistant in your browser!</p>
